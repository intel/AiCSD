# General Information
This guide provides general information for the overall collection of services at a system-level. Click on the 
hyperlinked name of the microservice in the **[Port Configurations](#port-configurations)** table below for service-level information.

## Image Processing

Images are processed and tracked using jobs. The job tracks the movement of the file, the status, and any results or outputs 
from the pipeline. To process a job, there are tasks that help match information about a job to the appropriate pipeline 
to run. The animation below demonstrates how a file gets automatically processed.

![FileMovement](../images/aicsd-arch-animation.gif)

1. The Input Device/Imager writes the file to the OEM file system in a directory that is watched by the File Watcher. When 
the File Watcher detects the file, it sends the job (JSON struct of particular fields) to the Data Organizer via HTTP Request.

2. The Data Organizer sends the job to the Job Repository to create the job in the Redis Database. The job information is then 
sent to the Task Launcher to determine if there is a task that matches the job. If there is, the job may proceed to the 
File Sender (OEM). 

3. The File Sender (OEM) is responsible for sending both the job and the file to the File Receiver (Gateway). Once the File
Receiver (Gateway) has written the file to the Gateway file system, the job may then be sent on to the Task Launcher. 

4. The Task Launcher verifies that there is a matching task for the job before sending it to the appropriate pipeline using
the EdgeX Message Bus (via Redis). The ML pipeline subscribes to the appropriate topic and processes the file in its pipeline.
The output file (if there is one) is written to the file system and the job is sent back to the Task Launcher. 

5. The Task Launcher then decides if there is an output file or if there are just results. In the case of only results and
no output file, the Task Launcher marks the job as complete. If there is an output file, the Task Launcher sends the job
onwards to the File Sender (Gateway). 

6. The File Sender (Gateway) publishes the job information to the EdgeX Message Bus via Redis for the File Receiver (OEM) to subscribe
and pull. The File Receiver (OEM) sends an HTTP request to the File Sender (Gateway) for the output file(s). 
The file(s) are sent as part of the response and the File Receiver (OEM) writes the output file(s) to the file system.

## Run Options

The top level Makefile contains the following make targets for running the microservices in docker.

!!! Note
    The AiCSD docker images are not pushed to any Docker Registry. They must be built locally prior to using the target(s) below that depend on those docker images.

| Option                                           | Description                                         |

| `make copy-files COPY_DIR=/path/to/input-images/to-copy SLEEP_TIME=<time in seconds>` | Used for manual testing on the OEM/single system setup for copying files from a specified COPY_DIR to the appropriate location while waiting the specified SLEEP_TIME (default 30s).                                                             |

### Run Integration Tests in a Docker Container

1. Build the docker image:

    ```bash
    make docker-integration-test
    ```
   
2. Run the container:

    ```bash
    docker run --net host -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -it --entrypoint="/bin/sh" aicsd/integration-test:0.0.0-dev
    ```

3. Once inside the shell, execute:

    ```bash
    make integration-test
    ```

## Services Fault Tolerance 

The services use a Go module called `wait-for-it` to wait on the availability of a TCP host and port.
The `wait-for-it` Go module is added to the microservices so that the services may wait for their dependencies to be up and ready as expected. It currently has a 15-second timeout and provides feedback as the dependent services become ready. If for some reason a service never becomes available, there is a one-minute maximum timeout, after which an error will be logged that a dependent service never became available.

## Documentation Using GitHub Pages
This repo leverages a GitHub Pages approach to represent markdown contents as navigable html web pages. To build and view the documentation locally, use:

   ```bash
   make serve-docs
   ```

!!! Tip
    Open a browser to view the contents: [localhost:8008](http://localhost:8008/)
