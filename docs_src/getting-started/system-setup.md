# Build and Deploy

## Build Containers

1. Use one of the command line options below to build: 

    | Build Type | Build Command                             | When To Use                                                                                                   |
    |:--------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | General Build | `make <docker-target>`                    | The system resources are unknown.                                                                             |
    | Fast Build    | `make -j<num of threads> <docker-target>` | The flag -j represents the number of jobs in a build. The optimal integer for j depends on the system resources (e.g., cores) and configuration. |

    Where `<docker-target>` can be one of the following:

    | Docker Target | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
    |---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | docker | builds all custom docker containers to run in a single system setup                                                                                                                                                  |
    | docker-build-gateway | builds [gateway](../services/ms-job-repository.md) custom docker containers                                                                                                                                          |
    | docker-build-oem | builds [oem](../services/ms-file-watcher.md) specific custom docker containers - this requires the [SSH Configuration](./choose-config.md#generate-key-(optional)) to be complete before the containers can be built |

    !!! Warning
        Leave plenty of time for this step to complete, up to 30-40 minutes. Console output may appear to hang while conducting parts of the build process using intermediate containers. Red text is not necessarily concerning, so allow the process to finish.

2. For a two system setup, it is necessary to update `<OEM_IP_ADDRESS>` with the appropriate IP address of the OEM system in the docker-compose-edgex-spiffe-spire.yml file. To obtain the IP address use `hostname -I` on Linux or `ipconfig` on Windows. 

    !!! Note
        For an OEM system running in WSL, use the IP address of the Windows system.


## Run the Services

The table below describes the different run options available. 


1. Run the docker images for the gateway (or all on one, if desired). Choose **one** of the run targets below (depends on the pipeline type and number of systems):

    !!! Note
        It is recommended to use the simulated pipeline for a trial setup. Using the simulated pipeline on a single system is the simplest configuration.

    | Pipeline Option                           | Run Target              | Description                                                            | Number of Containers |
    |:------------------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------:|
    | Simulated Pipeline (Gateway)              | `make run-gateway-sim`  | Run the AiCSD microservices with a set of simulated pipelines          |                   22 |
    | Simulated Pipeline (single system)        | `make run-sim`          | Run the AiCSD microservices with a set of simulated pipelines          |                   21 |
    | Geti Pipeline (Gateway)                   | `make run-gateway-geti` | Run the AiCSD microservices with Geti pipelines for the Gateway System |                   23 |
    | Geti Pipeline (single system)             | `make run-geti`         | Run the AiCSD microservices with Geti pipelines                        |                   22 |
    | OpenVino Model Server (Gateway or single) | `make run-ovms`         | Run the OVMS container                                                |                    1 |

    !!! Note
        The optional `GATEWAY_IP_ADDR=192.168.X.X` parameter can be added to the make command in order for the web UI to be accessed fom an external system. This command would read `make <run-option> GATEWAY_IP_ADDR=192.168.X.X`. To get the IP address of a Linux system run `hostname -I`.
    
    !!! Success
        For two system, verify that the logs of the `edgex-oem-ssh-proxy` container say
        ```bash
           + scp -p -o 'StrictHostKeyChecking=no' -o 'UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null' -P 2223 /srv/spiffe/remote-agent/agent.key '<OEM_IP_ADDRESS>:/srv/spiffe/remote-agent/agent.key'
           scp: Connection closed
           ssh: Could not resolve hostname <oem_ip_address>: Try again 
        ```
    !!! Success
        For an AiCSD microservice, the logs should look something like this task-launcher sample log:
        ```bash
           level=INFO ts=2023-06-12T16:58:55.042728315Z app=app-task-launcher source=server.go:162 msg="Starting HTTP Web Server on address task-launcher:59785"
           level=INFO ts=2023-06-12T16:58:55.043443755Z app=app-task-launcher source=messaging.go:104 msg="Subscribing to topic(s): 'NONE' @ redis://edgex-redis:6379"
           level=INFO ts=2023-06-12T16:58:55.043454019Z app=app-task-launcher source=messaging.go:113 msg="Publishing to topic: '{publish-topic}' @ redis://edgex-redis:6379"
           level=INFO ts=2023-06-12T16:58:55.04346657Z app=app-task-launcher source=service.go:202 msg="StoreAndForward disabled. Not running retry loop."
           level=INFO ts=2023-06-12T16:58:55.043471401Z app=app-task-launcher source=service.go:205 msg="Started the task launcher microservice"
           level=INFO ts=2023-06-12T16:58:55.043518377Z app=app-task-launcher source=messaging.go:125 msg="Waiting for messages from the MessageBus on the 'NONE' topic"
           level=DEBUG ts=2023-06-12T17:28:54.018134531Z app=app-task-launcher source=secrets.go:345 msg="token is successfully renewed"
        ```

2. For a two system setup, on the Gateway, add the server entries for the OEM side to authorize the services running on the OEM side.

    ```bash
      $ make add-ssh-server-entry
    ```

    !!! Note
        This only needs to be run the first time the Gateway services are started or after the volumes have been cleaned.

3. For a two system setup, start the OEM services on the OEM system. (This should start 6 containers.) 

    ```bash
      $ make run-oem
    ```
   
    !!! Warning
        The OEM system must be started within **one hour** of starting the Gateway system. 
        Failure to do so will result in the services not connecting or functioning properly.

    !!! Success
        The `edgex-remote-spire-agent` logs should have lines that look like:
        ```bash
            time="2023-06-05T22:20:35Z" level=debug msg="Fetched X.509 SVID" count=1 method=FetchX509SVID pid=3559771 registered=true service=WorkloadAPI spiffe_id="spiffe://edgexfoundry.org/service/app-file-receiver-oem" subsystem_name=endpoints ttl=3597.506151713
        ```
        An AiCSD microservice (ie `file-receiver-oem`) should look like:
        ```bash
            level=INFO ts=2023-06-07T15:31:23.916977876Z app=app-file-receiver-gateway source=server.go:162 msg="Starting HTTP Web Server on address file-receiver-gateway:59783"
        ```

   
3. Verify the correct number of containers are running using `docker ps` or `make run-portainer`. If using Portainer, open [Portainer](http://localhost:9000) in a browser. Here's an example screenshot of all the gateway services running in Portainer (high-level check that the stack is in a green/running state):
