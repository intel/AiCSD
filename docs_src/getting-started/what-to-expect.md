# What to Expect 
This guide details setup for two working models:
- Two System: a Linux Gateway and Windows WSL2 or Linux OEM where the two systems communicate to each other using a secure SSH Tunnel (port forwarding)
- Single System: a Linux or Windows WSL2 setup where all services for the OEM and Gateway will run on the same system, likely for development or test purposes.
For more information on the services that will be running and how the two systems will communicate, see [Image Processing](../services/general-info.md#image-processing).
