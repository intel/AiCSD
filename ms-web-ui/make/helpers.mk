# Adds targets that build and clean Docker images.
#
# Usage: $(call docker_targets,$(IMAGE_NAMES),$(IMAGE_DEPENDENCIES))
#
# You'll get a $(name).imagebuilt and .PHONY $(name) target for each image name,
# and they can be used (or depended upon) to build the image and output a sentinel.
# You'll also get a .PHONY clean-$(name) target to remove the image and sentinel.
# Finally, if not previously defined, it'll add a $(name)_dockerfile variable,
# which it lists as a dependency of the build target and passes to `docker build`.
#
# If you need to use a different Dockerfile for you build,
# you can define $(name)_dockerfile yourself
# or, if its name ends in the suffix 'Dockerfile', just list it as a dependency.
# As a result, all of these are equivalent:
#
#   Inferred automatically:
#     $(call docker_targets,myimage,foo bar)
#   Listed explicitly:
#     $(call docker_targets,myimage,Dockerfile foo bar)
#   Defined ahead of time:
#     myimage_dockerfile = Dockerfile
#     $(call docker_targets,myimage,foo bar)
#
# If you're building from multiple Dockerfiles, use one of the alternatives.
# You can, of course, call the function multiple times to list different dependencies.
#
# The "magic" of this function comes from using define/foreach/eval, as described here:
